This program draws Iterated Function System fractals interactively. It is largely based on the documentation provided by Michael Barnsley in his 1988 book Fractals Everywhere.

You will find ready-to-run binaries in the folder bin/release. Make sure to get the .dll's for the program to run.

USAGE:
Left-click to control transformation rectangles. You will need to add one to begin with, so try clicking in the lower-left, upper-left, and lower-right areas of the window.
Right-click to add another transformation.
'd' deletes the transformation currently highlighted under the cursor.
Spacebar renders the fractal at a higher resolution, without the transformation rectangles.
's' saves the current set of transformations in the file "boxes.txt" - do not modify this file if you want to open it again! It also saves the transformation numbers to the file "transformations.txt"
'o' loads "boxes.txt" to recover a previous fractal.
Use your mouse to edit existing transformations. Click-drag to move the various parts of each transformation box around.

CHANGELOG:
2012-04-29: Added primitive save and open functionality

COMPILING:
Open up "Fractal Class.cbp" in Code::Blocks and compile. Everything should be set up in the project file. This project uses SDL and the SDL_gfx libraries. There may be a couple Windows dependencies. Everything else should be contained in any standard C++ compiler.
