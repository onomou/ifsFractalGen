This program draws Iterated Function System fractals interactively. It is largely based on the documentation provided by Michael Barnsley in his 1988 book Fractals Everywhere.

You will find ready-to-run binaries in the folder bin/release. Make sure to get the .dll's for the program to run.

USAGE:
Left-click to control transformation rectangles. You will need to add one to begin with, so try clicking in the lower-left, upper-left, and lower-right areas of the window.
Right-click to add another transformation.
'd' deletes the transformation currently highlighted under the cursor.
Spacebar renders the fractal at a higher resolution, without the transformation rectangles.
Editing transformations should be intuitive, with a click-drag paradigm.

COMPILING:
Fractal Class.cbp is the one to use now. Fractal Generators.cbp is no longer being used, and its functions should have been replicated in the Class project.
