The aedGUI library
==================

The goal of this project is to create a cross-platform C++ Graphics
User Interface library to be used with Simple DirectMedia Layer (SDL).
It will be fast, non-intrusive and easy to use.


Requirements
------------

aedGUI requires at least SDL 1.2.5 and FreeType 2.0 libraries. SDL_ttf is
needed for rendering text, but if you don't have it, internal copy will be
used. Additionally, you may want to install SDL_rtf to enable the aedStaticRTF
widget which is used for displaying RTF text. If you want to build the OpenGL
test program you'll need OpenGL libraries as well.

NOTE: support for SDL 1.2.5 will be removed in version 0.2.0 (after that
      we will only support SDL 1.2.6 and above).


Building and installing from CVS
--------------------------------

First you need to get the sources from CVS:

    cvs -z3 -d:pserver:anonymous@cvs.sourceforge.net:/cvsroot/aedgui co aedGUI

Then you run

    ./autogen.sh

and proceed as usual:

    ./configure
    make
    make install

--------------
