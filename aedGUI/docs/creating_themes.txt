Creating new themes
--------------------

A new theme is made by creating your theme class using aedTheme as the base
class. You then override the constructor and any drawing functions you want.
In the constructor you should set default colors, font size and so on. You
should also fill in the m_ThemeInfo member with information about your theme
(theme name, author and theme description). Lastly, you have to create two global
functions, like this (assuming your derived class is named 'myTheme'):

extern "C" DLLEXPORT aedTheme *
get_theme_instance()
{
    return new myTheme;
}

extern "C" DLLEXPORT Uint16
get_pif_version()
{
    return AEDGUI_PIF_VERSION;
}

get_theme_instance returns a pointer to a newly created object of your theme
(not aedTheme!) and get_pif_version returns the plugin interface version
(always AEDGUI_PIF_VERSION) useful for detecting version inconsistencies
between the theme plugin and the application loading the theme. 

For more information look at include/aedTheme.h, src/aedTheme.cpp and
themes/theme1.cpp.
