This is the aedGUI TODO list
============================

In the near future:

* serialization support/xml layout loader
* aedSizers: some kind of sizer that could arrange the widgets on the screen 
  automagically (like gtk, wxWindows and more...)
* aedTextBox: implement text selection, cut, paste ...
* aedListBox: This will be hard. We will need a full featured list box with 
  multi-column, support for embedding other widgets, multiple "views" (report, 
  icons, etc...) and more...
* aedComboBox: a simple cross-widget featuring an aedTextBox and an aedListBox.
* aedMenu, aedMenuItem: a simple menu system
* aedToolBar: just a simple widget that will stack aedButtons, side by side
* aedDialogBox: this is simple, we need some kind of "MessageBox" to the user
  (for errors and such)
* aedMultiLineTextBox: multiline version of aedTextBox.
* define theme API

In the not-so-near future:

* aedTreeView: the name says it all
* aedToolTips: tooltips
* aedStatusBar: status bar
* aedNoteBook: tabbed control for configurations
